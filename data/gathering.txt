רבי נחמן ברעסלאווער
18 Tishrei, 5571
Rebbe Nachman, a great-grandson of the Baal Shem Tov, revived the Hasidic movement by combining the esoteric secrets of Judaism (the Kabbalah) with in-depth Torah scholarship. He attracted thousands of followers during his lifetime, and his influence continues today through many Hasidic movements such as Breslov Hasidism.[1] Rebbe Nachman  s religious philosophy revolved around closeness to God and speaking to God in normal conversation  as you would with a best friend.  The concept of hitbodedut is central to his thinking

21 Adar,
On one occasion Rabbi Elimelech and Reb Zushya were staying at an inn. Each night non-Jewish peasants would enter their room and jestingly beat the one who lay nearest the fireside, Reb Zushya. One night, Rabbi Elimelech offered to change places with his brother so that he could take the beatings instead. Suggesting that Reb Zushya had suffered enough of this  Divine admonishment  the agreement was made and Rabbi Elimelech lay next to the fire instead. That night, the common gentiles again entered to begin their jest. This time, however, one of them said that the one by the fire had taken his fair share of the treatment, and now it would be better to jest with the other one! Again Reb Zushya took the beatings. Afterwards, he told his brother that whatever is decided in Heaven transpires!

When news of the Admor  s petirah (passing away) spread, so many people rushed to Ger yesterday morning that although the railway dispatched extra trains there was hardly any space in the cars and thousands of people were still left without means to travel...
One (tram) car with seating for 44 people held over 200, not even leaving any standing room, and in another car some people fainted as a result of the overcrowded conditions...
When the time for tefillas Mincha arrived, all of the funeral-goers, 20,000 in number, stood in a field and davened Minchah together...
The brief words spoken by the Rav of Sochachov made a powerful impression.

He arrived at the Baal Shem Tov  s house, expecting to hear expositions of profound mysteries, but instead was told stories of the latter  s everyday life. Hearing only similar stories at each subsequent visit, Dov Baer decided to return home. Just as he was about to leave, he was summoned again to the Baal Shem Tov  s house. The Baal Shem Tov opened an Eitz Chaim of Rabbi Chaim Vital (Rabbi Isaac Luria  s chief disciple), and asked him to explain a certain passage. Rabbi Dov Baer did so to the best of his ability, but the Baal Shem Tov declared that he had not understood the real meaning of the passage. Dov Baer reviewed it once more and insisted that his interpretation was correct. The Baal Shem Tov then proceeded to explain the passage himself. Legend has it that, as he spoke, the darkness suddenly gave way to light, and angels appeared and listened to the Baal Shem Tov  s words.

Hershele Ostropoler
הערשעלע אסטראפאלער

The Goose
When Hershele was a child, he had a number of brothers and sisters, of which he was the smallest. Thus, whenever they had a meal, he  d be the last to get anything. As a result, whenever they had goose, he never got to eat a foot, which was his favorite part. One evening, he snuck into the kitchen before dinner and cut a foot off of the goose, slipping it under his shirt to hide.
During dinner, his father noticed that Hersheles shirt was grease-stained and that the goose  s left foot was missing.

-	 Hershele,  he said.  Did you take the gooses foot?
-	 No, father,  he said.  Maybe it was a one-footed goose.
-	 A one-footed goose? There  s no such thing!
-	 Sure there is. I  ll take you to see one after dinner.
That evening, Hershele took his father out to a lake near their village. A flock of geese were sleeping on the banks, each tucking one foot into its body so that only the other was visible.

-	 There  s one,  said Hershele, pointing. Thinking to outsmart his son, his father clapped, waking the goose and causing it to lower its other leg.
-	 There. Now, Hershele, will you admit that you stole-
-	 Wow, father! You just clapped and the goose grew a foot! Why didnt you do that to the one at the table?
